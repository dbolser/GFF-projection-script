USAGE
* See the POD in the the script and the PM.
* See the example 'mapping GFF' and input file.


EXAMPLE
  map_features.plx -g mapping.gff sample.gff > sample-mapped.gff


INSTALL

First, clone this git repo and cd:
  git clone https://github.com/dbolser/GFF-mapping-script.git
  cd GFF-mapping-script

Second, install any Perl module dependencies locally using cpanm. For very simple instructions on how to do this, see: http://goo.gl/iiYns .. On my system, I have to install the following:

  cpanm Bio::GFF3::LowLevel
  cpanm Bio::Location::Simple # Who says BioPerl isn't modular?
  cpanm MooseX::FileAttribute # Achem


TODO
* Write some tests.
* Improve error reporting (it's currently confusing).
* Make 'orphan sub-features' optional (we should kill them instead, mua-ha-ha-har).
* Add 'switch' as a command line option.
